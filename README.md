## Description
This is a neighbourhood application to allow members to see information, news and updates about their hoods. They can also easily find where town amenities are and emergency contact i.e hospital

## Usage
* Fork the repository and pull the files to your local environment
* Install flask and a virtual env.
* Install dependencies within the virtual env
* The pipfile will guide you on the needed modules. 
* Run the application by tyiping `python3.10 run.py`

## Issues
- Flask_Script  is not compatible with flask 2.1.2, which is what is used for 
this application. Downgarding Flask allows flask_script to run.. The cost wome things(i.e escape) in Jinja wont work with versions of Flask less that 2.0.0


## Setup
* Check the Pipfile for all modules needed for the application
* Run `pipenv shell` to start the virtual environment
* Run pipenv sync to install all the dependencies
* 


## Technologies Used
* Python
* Flask
* HTML
* CSS & Bootstrap CDN
